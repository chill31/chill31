I like to code a lot, I come home from school, study for 3 hours, take rest, code for 1 hour, play a little (outdoorsy sport) then rest, then do my homework...

I like/dislike github for a few reasons:

| Pros | Cons |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| Free hosting | Long and annoying process of commiting and pushing code. |
| saving process of code so if you make unwanted changes, you can delete them | Hosting does not work unless a repository is public | 

> github is good, do not get me wrong here.

Well, that's about it, see ya..
